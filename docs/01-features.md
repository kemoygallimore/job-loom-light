# RizonHire — Feature Inventory

_Last updated: May 12, 2026_

RizonHire is a **multi-tenant Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** with built-in video screening, public careers portals, and a super-admin platform layer. Data is strictly isolated per tenant via `company_id` row-level security.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

- Email/password sign-in (Supabase Auth) — **invite-only**, no public registration
- Forgot password / reset password flows
- Role-based access control via `user_roles` table:
  - `super_admin` — platform operator (no `company_id`)
  - `admin` — full company access (delete jobs/candidates, manage tags)
  - `user` — standard company member
- Session-aware route guards (`ProtectedRoutes`, `AuthRoute`) with loading states to prevent flicker
- Multi-tenant isolation via `get_user_company_id()` and `has_role()` security-definer functions

## 2. Dashboard

- Per-company KPI overview: open jobs, total candidates, applications by stage
- Quick links into Jobs, Candidates, and Pipeline

## 3. Jobs Module

- Create / edit / close jobs (title, hiring manager, rich-text description, status)
- Open-job limit enforced per tenant (`companies.max_open_jobs`)
- Public visibility once `status = 'open'`

## 4. Candidates Module

- Candidate list with search and filters:
  - Job applied to
  - Education level
  - **Parish / state** (location)
  - Tags
- Candidate profile page:
  - Contact details (email, phone, **LinkedIn URL**, address, parish/state, country)
  - Resume history with versioning (`candidate_files`, signed R2 download URLs)
  - Activity timeline
  - Notes (per-user, company-scoped)
  - Interview feedback log
  - Tag assignments
- Candidates can **only** be added through the public application link (no in-app create)
- Admin-only delete

## 8. Public Application Flow (`/apply/:jobId`)

- Anonymous candidate submission with:
  - Name, email, phone, address, parish/state, country, education level
  - Optional **LinkedIn profile URL** (validated client- and server-side via trigger)
  - Resume upload (private Cloudflare R2 via signed worker URL)
